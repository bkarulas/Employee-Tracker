# Employee-Tracker
##Unit 12 Assignment

In this assignment I created a functional database for a work environment. Once the tables were created and populated you are able to preform the following functions:

  * View all employees in the company:

![ALL EMPLOYEES](other/02.JPG)

  * View all employees in a department:

![DEPARTMENT](other/03.JPG)

  * View all employees and their manager:

![MANAGER](other/04.JPG)

  * You can add a new employee:

![NEW EMPLOYEES](other/06.JPG)
![NEW EMPLOYEES](other/07.1.JPG)

  * Change the role of any employee:

![CHANGE ROLL](other/09.JPG)
![CHANGE ROLL](other/10.1.JPG)

  * Change the manager of any employee:

![CHANGE MANAGER](other/12.JPG)
![CHANGE MANAGER](other/13.1.JPG)

  * And finally delete an employee:

![DELETE EMPLOYEE](other/14.JPG)
